This project aims to analyze food wastage in relation to staff experience, special events, temperature, and humidity. By understanding patterns in the dataset, we can propose strategies to minimize food waste and optimize staff allocation. The dataset includes key variables such as food wastage (in kg), staff experience levels (Beginner, Intermediate, etc.), special event occurrence (0 = No, 1 = Yes), ambient temperature, and humidity percentage.
